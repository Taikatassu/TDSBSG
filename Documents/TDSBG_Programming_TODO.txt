---------------------------------------------  i am smiley - TODO-list ---------------------------------------------------

Completed:
DONE Alert state system
DONE - Global security state (increases slowly by disobedience, but never decreases)
DONE - Global alert state (alert on / off) (more than two states needed?)
DONE - Instant alert triggered when progressing on global securit sale to the next level (~5 levels)
DONE - Enemy field of vision increases with Global seurity state
DONE - Vision cone angle and range increases when alerted

-REDESIGNED-
- Enemies return to normal functionaliy once alert has stopped
- Three alert states: No alert, Target in sight, Searching
- No alert: 
	- The default state
	- Enemies patrol their designated routes
	- If an enemy sees a possessable disobeying, they will sound an alarm and start chasing
	- The enemes ignore non-disobeying possessables
- Target in sight:
	- The initial alert state
	- When any enemy has a target in it's sights
	- Target = wanted possessable type (set when the alert starts or when an enemy detects a possessable disobeying)
- Searching:
	- The second alert state
	- When no enemies have possessables in sight, the initial alert state changes to this state
	- If an enemy sees a target, the alert state changes back to the prior one
	- When entering this state, a timer will start running (it will reset if the state changes)
	- Once the timer is at zero, the alert will end and the state will return to the default one (No alert)
-REDESIGNED-

DONE Simplified alert / chasing system
DONE - Enemies detect disobeying possessed possessables
	DONE - When detected, possessable cannot move and the detecting guard will come to investigate
	DONE - If the guard gets within catch range of a possessable possessed by the player, current level is restarted
	DONE - The player can however still possess possessables while detected and therefore possibly evade capture

DONE Methods of disobedience:
DONE - Enter a restricted room
	DONE - Room-class
		DONE - Room restrictions
		DONE - Level of security?
		(discarded feature) - Entering a room with higher level of security without 
		  		      proper clearance will result in higher disobedience increases
DONE - Pass through a restricted doorway
	DONE - Doorway-class
		DONE - Doorway restrictions
		DONE - Level of security?
DONE - Interact with a restricted object
	DONE - Interactable-class
		DONE - Object restrictions
		DONE - Level of security?
DONE - Harm humans (by shooting cans from vending machine)

DONE Enemies
DONE - Patrol
DONE - Vision cones
DONE - Alert system
	DONE - All enemies register to alert system when spawned
	DONE - When alert starts, alert system will notify all registered enemies
	- If no sight of target for a duration X, end alert
DONE - Chasing mechanics
DONE - PatrolPoint temporary guarding (enemy stops at a patrol point for a certain duration, before continuing on 
       it's route)
	DONE - A float value for guardDuration (if 0, no guarding, e.i. continue the patrol instantly)

DONE UI
DONE - Main menu
DONE - Pause menu
NOPE - HUD?

DONE Varying possessables
DONE - Change possession button from Q-key to mouse left click (on top of possessable)
DONE - Primary / secondary

	DONE - Robotic forklift
	DONE - Connected electronics (local network), e.g. tv screens / computers, etc...

DONE - Implement networked possessables
	DONE - Switching between nodes by clicking another connected node, regardless of range
	DONE - Switching between nodes is done by choosing the direction with mouse click
	DONE - "Manager" has info on all the connected nodes (an list of ints which signify paired nodes)
	DONE - Draw indicator lines between nodes

DONE Interactable objects
	DONE - Base
	DONE - Implement interactableObject interaction to mouse left click (on top of object)
	DONE - Various different functionalities
	DONE - bool stationaryInteractable (if true, user cannon move when interacting)
	DONE (changed to the user side) - float interactionStartDuration (how long it takes for the user to 
					  start interacting with the object)
	DONE - User cannot move while starting interaction with the object
	DONE (changed to the user side) - float interactionEndDuration (how long it takes for the user to end 
					  interaction with the object)
	DONE - User cannot move while ending interaction with the object
	DONE - float StartInteraction() (return -1 if cannot interact. return interactionStartDuration if can interact)
	DONE - float EndInteraction() (return -1 if cannot interact. return interactionEndDuration if can interact)
	DONE - permissionList (contains robotTypes that can interact with the object)

DONE Input
DONE - Mouse input events (buttons up / down, cursor location)

DONE Levels
DONE - Level manager
DONE - Level start
DONE- Level end
DONE - Spawn player with the last possessed possessable at level start
DONE - Load new scene once the player finishes a level
DONE - Load the initial scene when pressing the play button in main menu
DONE - Create a animation scene for the elevator doors opening and closing at the start and end of a level
	(- Possibly with some "cinematic" camera work)

TODO:
DONE - Fix debug manager
DONE - Find out why connected possessables don't always work
DONE - Implement visible connections to connected possessables (enabled on mouseover or when possessed)
DONE - Implement a way to pause all enemies during cutscenes without changing timescale
DONE - Rotate the possessable possessed by the player in the direction of movement (velocity direction)
DONE - Update scene indices if neccessary (ApplicationManager, UIManager, GameManager)
DONE - PaperMario-like multi-sided sprite animation controller
DONE - Implement rotatable camera
DONE - Redo Poss_Worker & Interactable_Liftable
DONE - Implement the rest of the sprites on enemies and possessables (spriteAnimationController)
DONE - Screen To GIF (make a GIF of the sprite enemy walking around in the scene (pull populated scene from git))
DONE - Check if all sprites exist (defaut robot, roomba, forklift, vending machine, radio?, enemies)
DONE - Rotate possessed possessable controls with camera
DONE - Forklift prefab
DONE - Vending Machine prefab
DONE - Door lerp moves the doors too far away?
DONE - Guards cannot open doors?
DONE - Implement game over when seen / Finish alert system 
DONE - Guards send an event when they see a disobeying possessable (also start alarm)
DONE - The spotted possessed cannot move while the guards run to it
DONE - If it was the player, game over
DONE - If it was not the player, guards return to patrolling
DONE - Implement the pause menu restart functionality
DONE - Top sprites
DONE - Opening pausemenu does not prevent mouse interaction with the scene
DONE - Main menu background
DONE - KnockedOut enemies continue to their navMesh destination
DONE - Reset lastPossessedRobotType when restarting first level
DONE - If switching out of and back to a forklift possessable while an interactable is lifted, the forklift is 
       unable to lower the object
	   (- The problem seems to persist without the elevator as well (just cannon lower a lifted object))
DONE - Game over screen
DONE - Remove roomba from the beginning of level_02
DONE - Game completed screen
DONE - Loading screen
DONE - Enemies can travel through vents (technically still possible, practically should not happen in 
       vast majority of cases)

Suggestions for future development:
- Implement slight smooth on the possessed possessable rotation
- Simple AI for the possessables (they should have tasks to complete to keep them occuped until the player 
  possesses them)
- Implement any possessable detection support to enemies (so that enemies can detect any and all disobeying
  possessables, even those not currently possessed by the player)
- Secondary possessables (stationary turrets, etc.)
- More enemy types (stationary turrets, etc.)
- Create spawners for Possessibles, to ensure newest version of prefab is always loaded 
  (currently placed within other prefabs in scene, which overrides prefab instance auto updating)




--------------------------------------------------- End Of IGCC 2107 -----------------------------------------------------


Build 1.01

Completed:
DONE - Credits (triple check everyones full names and proper titles)
	DONE - Main menu button "credits" (opens credits screen)
	DONE - While in credits screen, new button "Close" is available
	DONE - If pressed, credits panel will close and main menu will be opened (actually already open in the background)
	DONE - Esc key will also close the credits panel
DONE - Redo loading screen
	DONE - Open loading screen when starting to load new level, load new level and close loading screen once timer is out
	DONE - Prevent game pause during loading sceens
DONE - Zero out possessable movement when pausing the game (currently the last movement direction stays and the possessable
       continues moving in that direction after unpausing until re-pressing the button after unpausing, even though it does 
       not move during a pause)
DONE - Calculate top view sprite angle properly (instead of just using camera height)
DONE - Modifiy connected node possessing to possess the node in click direction even if clicked on an interactable or 
       possessable when those interactions fail (are too far)
DONE - Add the correct (missing a few) door permission indicators next to Level_03 doors
DONE - Remove unnecessary objects in Level_03
DONE - Some Level_03 doors should auto-close but do not
DONE - Move the sofa in Level_02 lobby to the side a bit (so the player doesn't have to circle around it twice during 
       the level)
DONE - Modify Level_02 final room Poss_CleanerBot placement (currently too close to connected display node and therefore 
       hard to notice. Same with CleanerBot in the first bathroom)
DONE - Remove colliders from soda cans in Level_02 second bathroom area (currenly partially blocking player movement in 
       the area)
DONE - Some sprites on the office workers jump during animation (office workers. Possibly different pivot point?)
DONE - Increase guard stun duration (implement visible stun timer?)
DONE - Make forklift interaction with the Level_03 security door more obvious
DONE - Some top sprites get left on even when returning to side view (apparently those are old versions of the robots, 
       replacing them with the new prefabs should fix things)
	DONE - Level_02 last CleaningBot (front idle placement is off to the side)
DONE - Lowering liftable objects back to the ground with a forklift will place them floating slightly off the ground
DONE - Enemies can still see through Level_03 vents
DONE - Fix Level_03 puzzles
	DONE - Some of the puzzles in Level_03 can be skipped by holding doors open with other robots (reposition guards 
	       so that those doors are practically inaccessible to the roomba)
DONE - Fix sprite players on prop plants
DONE - Fix door permission indicator light location (public transform for all doors to be used as spawn location)
DONE - Camera collision with environment / auto transparency to walls (somehow prevent environment from 
       blocking the player's vision)
DONE - Player indicator draw order under character sprites
DONE - Add a volume slider in main menu and the pause menu
DONE - Fix game over screen displaying (display for x time until reloading the scene. Currenly practically never visible
       because new scene is instantly loaded and a loading screen is displayed on top of it)
DONE - Remove all unnecessary Debug.Log prints
DONE - Check through all "TODO" comments in script, and fix / complete all WIP features deemed necessary
DONE - Disable security manager?
DONE - Vending machine possession does not work!?
DONE - Enemy fov not visible
DONE - Fix forklift liftable placement
DONE - Modify interactible door so that the current openers are stored in a list, and the door closes only 
       after the list is completely empty
DONE - Add star particles to the knock out meter and tweak draw order (should always be on top of all characters)
DONE - Polish connected node indicator effect
DONE - Polish soda can hit effect
DONE - Open credits screen after game completion
DONE - Increase door trigger size
DONE - Finish field of view mesh calculation optimization
	DONE - Find out why the last two faces of the mesh are not drawn



TODO:
- Some way to show the user the controls of the game (prompt when possessing a robot that can do something with 
  the "use" button? A tutorial screen accessible from the main menu?)
- Post processing?
- Add required credits to all third party assets (e.g. free license audio files)!!
- Take damage, knocked out and directional top sprites (Playtester critique: top sprites don't show character 
  animations (knockedOut, takeDamage))
WIP - Audio
	DONE - Music for levels (starts playing when a level is loaded, once the loading screen closes)
	DONE - Music for main menu (starts playing when main menu is loaded, once the loading screen closes)
	WIP - Requestable audio clips for gameplay events (game over, game completed, etc. Scene background music continues
	    after the sound effect is played)
	- Toggleable SoundEffects for all characters
	- Implement final audio files
	- Audio clips needed:
		Priority:
		- Main menu music
		- Level 01 music
		- Level 02 music
		- Level 03 music
		- Elevator arrived sound effect (played at the beginning of each level)
		Secondary:
		- Alarm / whistle or something similar (played when a guard detects the player)
		- Game over sound effect
		- Game completed sound effect
		Wishlist:
		- Sound effects for doors (elevator, security, automatic)
		- Move and idle effects for all characters (footsteps for humans, electric whirring / humming for robots)
		- Mumbling / grumbling / whistling effects for human characters (played when player is close to humans)
		- Elevator music (played during loading screens, loading screens last for 2 seconds atm)
		- Shoot effect for vending machine and hit effect for soda can
		- Electric beeping noises (played when possessing robots)
		- ?
