Alert state system
DONE - Global security state (increases slowly by disobedience, but never decreases)
DONE - Global alert state (alert on / off) (more than two states needed?)
DONE - Instant alert triggered when progressing on global securit sale to the next level (~5 levels)
DONE - Enemy field of vision increases with Global seurity state
DONE - Vision cone angle and range increases when alerted

-REDESIGNED-
- Enemies return to normal functionaliy once alert has stopped
- Three alert states: No alert, Target in sight, Searching
- No alert: 
	- The default state
	- Enemies patrol their designated routes
	- If an enemy sees a possessable disobeying, they will sound an alarm and start chasing
	- The enemes ignore non-disobeying possessables
- Target in sight:
	- The initial alert state
	- When any enemy has a target in it's sights
	- Target = wanted possessable type (set when the alert starts or when an enemy detects a possessable disobeying)
- Searching:
	- The second alert state
	- When no enemies have possessables in sight, the initial alert state changes to this state
	- If an enemy sees a target, the alert state changes back to the prior one
	- When entering this state, a timer will start running (it will reset if the state changes)
	- Once the timer is at zero, the alert will end and the state will return to the default one (No alert)
-REDESIGNED-

Methods of disobedience:
DONE - Enter a restricted room
	- Room-class
		- Room restrictions
		- Level of security?
		- Entering a room with higher level of security without 
		  proper clearance will result in higher disobedience increases
DONE - Pass through a restricted doorway
	- Doorway-class
		- Doorway restrictions
		- Level of security?
DONE - Interact with a restricted object
	- Interactable-class
		- Object restrictions
		- Level of security?
DONE - Harm humans (by shooting cans from vending machine)

Enemies
DONE - Patrol
DONE - Vision cones
DONE - Alert system
	DONE - All enemies register to alert system when spawned
	DONE - When alert starts, alert system will notify all registered enemies
	- If no sight of target for a duration X, end alert
DONE - Chasing mechanics
DONE - PatrolPoint temporary guarding (enemy stops at a patrol point for a certain duration, before continuing on 
       it's route)
	DONE - A float value for guardDuration (if 0, no guarding, e.i. continue the patrol instantly)

UI
DONE - Main menu
DONE - Pause menu
NOPE - HUD?

Varying possessables
DONE - Change possession button from Q-key to mouse left click (on top of possessable)
DONE - Primary / secondary
DONE - Different abilities / functionalities
DONE - Radio, Vending machine, Roomba, Robotic forklift, 
       Connected electronics (local network), e.g. tv screens / computers, etc...
WIP - Implement networked possessables
	DONE - Switching between nodes by clicking another connected node, regardless of range
	DONE - Switching between nodes is done by choosing the direction with mouse click
	DONE - "Manager" has info on all the connected nodes (an list of ints which signify paired nodes)
	DONE - Draw indicator lines between nodes

Interactable objects
	DONE - Base
	DONE - Implement interactableObject interaction to mouse left click (on top of object)
	DONE - Various different functionalities
	DONE - bool stationaryInteractable (if true, user cannon move when interacting)
	DONE (changed to the user side) - float interactionStartDuration (how long it takes for the user to 
					  start interacting with the object)
	DONE - User cannot move while starting interaction with the object
	DONE (changed to the user side) - float interactionEndDuration (how long it takes for the user to end 
					  interaction with the object)
	DONE - User cannot move while ending interaction with the object
	DONE - float StartInteraction() (return -1 if cannot interact. return interactionStartDuration if can interact)
	DONE - float EndInteraction() (return -1 if cannot interact. return interactionEndDuration if can interact)
	DONE - permissionList (contains robotTypes that can interact with the object)


Input
DONE - Mouse input events (buttons up / down, cursor location)

Levels
DONE - Level manager
DONE - Level start
DONE- Level end
DONE - Spawn player with the last possessed possessable at level start
DONE - Load new scene once the player finishes a level
DONE - Load the initial scene when pressing the play button in main menu
DONE - Create a animation scene for the elevator doors opening and closing at the start and end of a level
	(- Possibly with some "cinematic" camera work)

TODO:
DONE - Fix debug manager
DONE - Find out why connected possessables don't always work
DONE - Implement visible connections to connected possessables (enabled on mouseover or when possessed)
DONE - Implement a way to pause all enemies during cutscenes without changing timescale
DONE - Rotate the possessable possessed by the player in the direction of movement (velocity direction)
DONE - Update scene indices if neccessary (ApplicationManager, UIManager, GameManager)
DONE - PaperMario-like multi-sided sprite animation controller
DONE - Implement rotatable camera
DONE - Redo Poss_Worker & Interactable_Liftable
DONE - Implement the rest of the sprites on enemies and possessables (spriteAnimationController)
DONE - Screen To GIF (make a GIF of the sprite enemy walking around in the scene (pull populated scene from git))
DONE - Check if all sprites exist (defaut robot, roomba, forklift, vending machine, radio?, enemies)
DONE - Rotate possessed possessable controls with camera
DONE - Forklift prefab
DONE - Vending Machine prefab
DONE - Door lerp moves the doors too far away?
DONE - Guards cannot open doors?
DONE - Implement game over when seen / Finish alert system 
DONE - Guards send an event when they see a disobeying possessable (also start alarm)
DONE - The spotted possessed cannot move while the guards run to it
DONE - If it was the player, game over
DONE - If it was not the player, guards return to patrolling
DONE - Implement the pause menu restart functionality
DONE - Top sprites
DONE - Opening pausemenu does not prevent mouse interaction with the scene
DONE - Main menu background
DONE - KnockedOut enemies continue to their navMesh destination
DONE - Reset lastPossessedRobotType when restarting first level
DONE - If switching out of and back to a forklift possessable while an interactable is lifted, the forklift is 
       unable to lower the object
	   (- The problem seems to persist without the elevator as well (just cannon lower a lifted object))
DONE - Game over screen
DONE - Remove roomba from the beginning of level_02
DONE - Game completed screen
DONE - Loading screen
- Implement slight smooth on the possessed possessable rotation
- Some sprites on the office workers jump during animation (office workers. Possibly different pivot point?)
- Enemies can travel through vents?
- Simple AI for the possessables (they should have tasks to complete to keep them occuped until the player 
  possesses them)
- Camere collision with environment / auto transparency to walls (somehow prevent environment from 
  blocking the player's vision)
